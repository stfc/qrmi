.. _contributing_fork:

Forking the QRMI repository
---------------------------

It is recommended that contributors `fork the QRMI repository`_.
This allows contributors to make changes in their own forked repository, any branches on the fork can be submitted as pull requests to the main QRMI repository.

.. _fork the QRMI repository: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/how-tos/work-with-forks/fork-a-repo

Once the forked repository is set up, you can clone it to your local machine and create a new branch for your changes.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/qrmi.git
      cd qrmi
      git checkout -b fix/my-change


Setting up the developer environment
------------------------------------


.. _contributing_venv:

Create a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual environments are used for QRMI development to isolate the
development environment from system-wide packages. This way, we avoid
inadvertently becoming dependent on a particular system configuration.
For developers, this also makes it easy to maintain multiple
environments (e.g. one per supported Python version, for older versions
of QRMI, etc.).

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Conda (Rust/C)

      For Conda users, a new environment can be created as follows:

      .. code-block:: bash

         conda create -y -n QRMIDevenv python=3
         conda activate QRMIDevenv

      Install the QRMI Rust/C dependencies:

      .. code-block:: bash

         . ~/.cargo/env
         cargo clean
         cargo build --locked --release

      Optionally, you can install the Python dependencies too:

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install -e .

   .. tab:: venv (Python)

      All Python versions supported by Qiskit include a built-in virtual
      environment module, `venv`_.

      .. _venv: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

      Start by creating a new virtual environment with ``venv``. The resulting
      environment will use the same version of Python that created it and will
      not inherit installed system-wide packages by default. The specified
      folder will be created and is used to hold the environment's
      installation. It can be placed anywhere. For more details, see the
      official Python documentation, `Creation of virtual environments`_.

      .. _Creation of virtual environments: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/qrmi-dev

      Activate the environment by invoking the appropriate activation script
      for your system, which can be found within the environment folder. For
      example, for bash/zsh:

      .. code-block:: bash

         source ~/.venvs/qrmi-dev/bin/activate

      Upgrade ``pip`` within the environment to ensure QRMI dependencies installed
      in the subsequent sections can be located for your system. You need
      ``pip>=25.1`` to use the ``--group`` feature, used to manage developer
      dependency groups:

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install -U pip

      You can easily install all the standard developer dependencies for
      in-place testing, documentation-building, and linting using:

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


Install QRMI from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :ref:`install`.


.. _contributing_issues:

Issues and pull requests
------------------------

We use `GitHub pull requests`_ to accept contributions.

.. _GitHub pull requests: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests

While not required, it is best practice to **open a new issue for bug fixes 
and feature development**, before opening a pull request. This allows
discussion with the community about your work:

.. important::

   Issues provide a place to talk about the idea and how we can work together
   to implement it in the code. They let the community know what you are
   working on and offer help and feedback. Issues are numbered and can be
   referenced during discussions with other community and team members.

If you've written some code but need help finishing it, want to get
initial feedback on it prior to finishing it, or want to share it and
discuss prior to finishing the implementation, you can open a **Draft
pull request**. This indicates to reviewers that the code in the PR isn't final
and will change. Once the PR is finalised, click ``Ready for review`` to convert 
the draft into a review-ready PR.

Before marking your PR as "ready for review", make sure you
have followed the PR checklist below. PRs that adhere to this list are
more likely to be reviewed and merged in a timely manner.


.. _pull_request_checklist:

Pull request checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When submitting a pull request for review, please ensure that:

#. The code follows the **code style** of the project and successfully
   passes the **CI tests**. For convenience, you can execute the following
   commands locally, which will run these checks and report any issues.

   -  ``make lint-rust-all``
   -  ``make lint-wheels``
   -  ``make fmt-rust``
   -  ``make fmt-python``

#. The **documentation has been updated** accordingly and **any new documentation 
   has been added**. Ensure the documentation can be 
   :ref:`successfully built locally <building_documentation>` before requesting 
   workflows to run.

#. Any changes to functions or classes are reflected in **updated docstrings**.

#. Any additional tests, where warranted, have been added and tested locally.

#. Any changes that impact the end-user (new feature, deprecation, 
   removal, etc.) include a Reno release note for that change and that
   the PR is tagged for the changelog.

#. All contributors have signed the :ref:`CLA <cla>`.

#. The PR has a concise and descriptive title.

   - ``Fixes Issue1234`` is a bad title. ``Fix <ERROR_NAME>`` is much more descriptive.

#. The PR description includes the ``Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`` syntax to link the PR to
   the relevant open issue.

   - You must use the **exact phrasing** for GitHub to automatically close the issue when the PR merges.


Pre-commit ``detect-secrets``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``detect-secrets`` is an open-source, developer-friendly tool designed
to scan codebases for mistakenly committed secrets (such as API keys,
passwords, and private tokens) before they leak. To keep our credentials
secure, we recommend that all developers integrate this into their
workflow using the following instructions:

.. attention::
   Before you begin, ensure you have a **Python virtual environment** (i.e. ``venv``) active. You will need to install ``pre-commit``, which manages the hooks that run ``detect-secrets`` automatically.


Installing ``pre-commit``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Run the following commands in your virtual environment terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install

Find ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` for the initial setup. 

#. Run the following command to generate a ``.secrets.baseline`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

   detect-secrets scan --force-use-all-plugins > .secrets.baseline

The baseline records known false positives so future scans focus on newly introduced secrets.


Handling false positives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the pre-commit hook identifies a secret that you have verified is not sensitive
(a false positive), please use the following command to audit and update the baseline file.
Once updated, include the modified .secrets.baseline in your PR to ensure the pre-commit passes in the future.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install detect-secrets
   detect-secrets scan --force-use-all-plugins --exclude-files '.secrets.*' --exclude-files '.git*' --baseline .secrets.baseline
   detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline


Manual execution and overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To manually trigger a scan of all files in the repository for a local sanity check,
execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pre-commit run --all-files


Bypassing the hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: 

   Bypassing the hook is not recommended.

If you must force a commit without running the pre-commit checks
(e.g. during an emergency fix), you may use the ``--no-verify`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   git commit -m "Your message" --no-verify


Code Review
~~~~~~~~~~~

Code review is transparent and open to anyone. While only
maintainers have permission to merge commits, community feedback on pull
requests is extremely valuable. It is also a good way to learn
about the code base.

Response times may vary for your PR. It is not unusual to wait a few
weeks for a maintainer to review your work, due to other internal
commitments. If you have been waiting over a week for a review on your
PR, feel free to tag the relevant maintainer in a comment to politely
remind them to review your work.

Please be patient! Maintainers have a number of other priorities to
focus on, therefore it may take some time for your work to be reviewed and
merged. PRs that are in a good shape (i.e. following the 
:ref:`pull request checklist <pull_request_checklist>`) are easier for maintainers
to review and are more likely to get merged in a timely manner. 

Please also make sure to always be kind and respectful in your interactions with
maintainers and other contributors, in line with the :ref:`QRMI Code of Conduct <code_of_conduct>`.


.. _contributing_docs:

Documentation
-------------

Documentation contributions are welcome. When modifying public APIs,
examples, configuration files, or user-facing behaviour, please update
the relevant documentation as part of the same pull request.

Refer to :ref:`adding_documentation` for further guidance.


.. _contributing_testing:

Testing
-------

Once you've made a code change, it is important to verify that it doesn't break 
any existing tests and that newly added tests run successfully. Before 
you open a new pull request for your change, run QRMI's Python test suite. If you've
modified native code, you should also run its Rust-based unit tests.

More information about QRMI's testing suite is available in our :ref:`testing documentation <testing>`.


.. _contributing_unit_tests:

Running unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Python

      `pytest`_ offers the easiest way to run QRMI's Python test suite.

      .. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/

      You can install pytest using ``pip``: 

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         pip install -U pytest

      To run QRMI's Python test suite:

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install "$(ls ./target/wheels/qrmi-*.whl)[ibm,pasqal]"
         pytest .

   .. tab:: Rust

      Many of QRMI's core data structures and code are implemented in Rust.

      ``cargo test`` is responsible for Rust unit testing. Rust tests are
      integrated directly into the Rust file being tested within a ``tests``
      module. Functions within these modules decorated with ``#[test]`` are
      built and run as tests.

      .. code-block:: rust
         :linenos:

         #[cfg(test)]
         mod tests {
            #[test]
            fn my_first_test() {
               assert_eq!(2, 1 + 1);
            }
         }

      For more detailed information on how to write Rust tests, you can refer to
      the Rust documentation's guidance on `writing tests`_.

      .. _writing tests: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html

      To execute the tests with the makefile, a ``make test`` target is
      available. The execution of the tests (both via the make target and
      during manual invocation) takes into account the ``LOG_LEVEL``
      environment variable.


.. Unsafe code and Miri
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Any ``unsafe`` code added to the Rust logic must be executed by
.. Rust-space tests, in addition to the more complete Python test suite. In
.. CI, we run the Rust test suite under `Miri`_ as an undefined-behavior
.. sanitizer.

.. .. _Miri: https://github.com/rust-lang/miri

.. Miri is currently only available on ``nightly`` Rust channels, so to run
.. it locally you will need to ensure you have that channel available:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..    rustup install nightly --components miri

.. After this, you can run the Miri test suite using the following command:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..    MIRIFLAGS="<FLAGS_GO_HERE>" cargo +nightly miri test

.. For the current set of ``MIRIFLAGS`` used by Qiskit's CI, see the
.. `miri.yml`_ GitHub Action file. This same file may also include patches to
.. dependencies to make them compatible with Miri, which you would need to
.. temporarily apply as well.

.. .. _miri.yml: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/.github/workflows/miri.yml


.. Testing the C API

.. _contributing_style:

Style and linting
-----------------

Contributors must run the below commands to fix and verify any formatting issues prior to submitting a PR:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Rust

      Fix any formatting issues:

      .. code-block:: bash

         . ~/.cargo/env
         cargo fmt --all -- --check
         cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
         cd examples/rust
         cargo fmt --all -- --check
         cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

      QRMI uses `rustfmt`_ for Rust formatting and linting. You can run ``cargo fmt``
      (if you installed Rust with the default settings using ``rustup``), and it will
      automatically update the code formatting according to the style guidelines.

      .. _rustfmt: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt

      For lint checking, QRMI uses `clippy`_ which can be invoked using ``cargo clippy``.

      .. _clippy: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy

   .. tab:: C

      To format C code, QRMI uses `clang-format`_. The style is based on LLVM,
      with a few QRMI-specific adjustments.

      .. _clang-format: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html

   .. tab:: Python

      Execute the following commands:

      .. code-block:: bash

         source ~/py312_qrmi_venv/bin/activate
         cd examples
         pylint ./python
         black --check ./python

      QRMI uses two tools for Python code formatting and lint checking. The
      first tool is `black`_ which is a code formatting tool that will automatically
      update the code formatting to a consistent style.

      .. _black: https://github.com/psf/black

      The second tool is `pylint`_, which is a code linter capable of deeper
      analysis of the Python code to find both style issues and potential bugs
      and other common issues.

      .. _pylint: https://pypi.org/project/pylint/


.. _contributing_release:
